# Hands-on JavaScript Async/await

> Purpose of the this hands-on training is to teach the students JavaScript async/await.

## Outline

- Part 1 - What is `async/await` function?

- Part 2 - Async Function

- Part 3 - Await

- Part 4 - Error handling

- Part 5 - `asyn/await` Example

### Part 1 - What is `async/await` function?

---

- More recent additions to the JavaScript language are async functions and the await keyword, part of the so-called ECMAScript 2017 JavaScript edition.
- Async/await functions help us even more in allowing us to write completely synchronous-looking code while performing asynchronous tasks behind the scenes.

Syntax :

```js
async function name([param[, param[, ...param]]]) {
   statements
}
```

### Part 2 - Async Function

---

- Let’s start with the async keyword. It can be placed before a function, like this:

```js

```

### Part 3 - Await

---

Syntax :

```js
// await works only inside async functions
let value = await promise;
```

```js

```

- ⛔ Can’t use await in regular functions.

### Part 4 - Error handling

- If a promise resolves normally, then await promise returns the result. But in the case of a rejection, it throws the error, just as if there were a throw statement at that line.

```js

```

### Part 5 - `asyn/await` Example

---

- We will do a basic `async/await` example.

```html

```
