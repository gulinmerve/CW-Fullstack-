# Hands-on JavaScript-Operators

> Purpose of the this hands-on training is to teach the students JavaScript Operators.

## Learning Outcomes

> At the end of the this hands-on training, students will be able to use;

- JavaScript Assignment Opeartors
- Adding assignment operator(+)
- Subtraction assignment operator(-)
- Multiplication assignment operator(\*)
- Division assignment operator(/)
- Adding Strings and Numbers
- Remainder assignment operator(%=)
- Exponentiation assignment (\*\*=)
- Logical AND assignment (&&=)
- Logical OR assignment (||=)
- Logical nullish assignment (??=)
- JavaScript Typeof Operator

## Outline

### Part 1 - JavaScript Assignment Opeartors

---

- Define new variables and use assignment operators.

```js

```

Operator : x = y

### Part 2 - Adding assignment operator(`+`)

---

- The addition assignment operator (+=) adds the value of the right operand to a variable and assigns the result to the variable.

```js

```

Operator : x += y  
Meaning : x = x + y

### Part 3 - Subtraction assignment operator(-)

---

- The subtraction assignment operator (-=) subtracts the value of the right operand from a variable and assigns the result to the variable.

```js

```

Operator : x -= y  
Meaning : x = x - y

### Part 4 - Multiplication assignment operator(`*`)

---

>

- The multiplication assignment operator (`_=`) multiplies a variable by the value of the right operand and assigns the result to the variable.

```js

```

Operator : x _= y  
Meaning : x = x _ y

### Part 5 - Division assignment operator(`/`)

---

- The division assignment operator (/=) divides a variable by the value of the right operand and assigns the result to the variable.

```js

```

Operator : x /= y  
Meaning : x = x / y

### Part 6 - Adding Strings and Numbers

---

>

- Adding two numbers, will return the sum, but adding a number and a string will return a string:

```js

```

&#10071; If you add a number and a string, the result will be a string!

### Part 7 - Remainder assignment operator(%=)

---

- The remainder assignment operator (%=) divides a variable by the value of the right operand and assigns the remainder to the variable.

```js

```

Operator : x %= y
Meaning : x = x % y

### Part 8 - Exponentiation assignment (\*\*=)

---

- The exponentiation assignment operator (\*\*=) raises the value of a variable to the power of the right operand.

```js

```

Operator : x **= y
Meaning : x = x ** y

### Part 9 - Logical AND assignment (&&=)

---

- The logical AND assignment (x &&= y) operator only assigns if x is truthy.

```js

```

Syntax :

```js
expr1 &&= expr2;
```

Using Logical AND Assignment

```js

```

### Part 10 - Logical OR assignment (||=)

---

- The logical OR assignment (x ||= y) operator only assigns if x is falsy.

```js

```

Syntax :

```js
expr1 ||= expr2;
```

```js

```

- Example : If the "content" element is empty, set the innerHTML to a default value:

```js

```

### Part 11 - Logical nullish assignment (??=)

---

>

- The logical nullish assignment (x ??= y) operator only assigns if x is nullish (null or undefined).

```js

```

Syntax :

```js
expr1 ??= expr2;
```

- Using logical nullish assignment

```js

```

### Part 12 - JavaScript Typeof Operator

---

- You can use the typeof operator to find the data type of a JavaScript variable.

Syntax :

```js
typeof variable;
```

```js

```
